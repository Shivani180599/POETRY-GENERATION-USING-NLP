# LSTM BASED POETRY GENERATION USING NLP BY TELEGRAM BOT
In this project we worked on Natural Language Processing (NLP) by
building an LSTM-based poetry generator.

Long short-term memory (LSTM) is an artificial neural network used in the fields of artificial intelligence and deep learning. Unlike standard feedforward neural networks, LSTM has feedback connections. Such a recurrent neural network (RNN) can process not only single data points (such as images), but also entire sequences of data (such as speech or video). This characteristic makes LSTM networks ideal for processing and predicting data.

The dataset is a compilation of poetries written by numerous poets
present in the form of a text file.
